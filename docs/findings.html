            <p>
                Using bivariate classification of shooting density and transport time terciles, 
                we identified <strong>18 census tracts (4.4% of the city)</strong> as trauma deserts. 
                These tracts have both high violence burden and extended transport times to Level I 
                trauma care.

                This finding suggests that the "trauma desert" phenomenon in Philadelphia is driven 
                primarily by <strong>violence concentration</strong>, not by poor geographic access 
                to trauma care.

                However, <strong>a counterintuitive finding emerges</strong>: predominantly Black 
                neighborhoods are actually <em>closer</em> to Level I trauma centers on average. 
                The correlation between percent Black and transport time is negative (r = -0.25, p &lt; 0.0001).

            <h2>4. Oaxaca-Blinder Decomposition</h2>
            <p>
                To rigorously quantify the racial disparity, we applied Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition 
                to separate the gap between predominantly Black tracts and other tracts.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Shooting Density Gap</h3>
            <p>
                Predominantly Black tracts experience <strong>4.4x higher shooting density</strong> 
                (geometric mean ratio). The decomposition reveals:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>31.5% Explained:</strong> Attributable to differences in poverty rates and median income</li>
                <li><strong>68.5% Unexplained:</strong> Residual gap that cannot be attributed to observable socioeconomic characteristics</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The large unexplained portion suggests structural and historical factors beyond 
                current socioeconomic conditions contribute to the concentration of violence.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Transport Time Gap</h3>
            <p>
                Black tracts are <strong>3.2 minutes closer</strong> to Level I trauma centers 
                on average. This finding confirms that the disparity in trauma burden is not 
                compounded by geographic access barriers.

            <h3>Stop the Bleed Training Prioritization</h3>
            <p>
                We identified 20 priority zones for community hemorrhage control training based 
                on a composite score of shooting density and transport time. The top 20 zones 
                contain 126,586 residents and experienced 2,607 shootings over the study period.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conservative estimates suggest community-based hemorrhage control training in 
                these zones could potentially save approximately 7 lives annually.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Scenario Modeling</h3>
            <p>
                Hypothetical placement of new trauma facilities was modeled at 8 candidate locations. 
                Key findings (using approximate distance-based travel time estimates):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hunting Park:</strong> Highest overall impact score (would improve access for 198,932 residents)</li>
                <li><strong>Kingsessing/Cobbs Creek:</strong> Would help the most trauma desert tracts (8 of 18)</li>
                <li><strong>Frankford/Mayfair:</strong> Would reach the largest population (323,391)</li>
            </ul>
