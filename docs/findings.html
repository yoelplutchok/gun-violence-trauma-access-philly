            <p>
                Using bivariate classification of shooting density and transport time terciles, 
                we identified <strong>18 census tracts (4.4% of the city)</strong> as trauma deserts. 
                These tracts have both high violence burden and extended transport times to Level I

                A critical question is whether transport time to trauma care actually affects mortality. 
                Using the fatality status recorded in the shooting data, we tested the association between 
                modeled transport time and fatality outcomes.

                <strong>Limitations:</strong> Fatality status in shooting data reflects ultimate outcome,

                transport was possible. Transport time is modeled from tract centroid, not actual 
                incident location. We cannot control for injury severity beyond wound location.

                This finding suggests that the "trauma desert" phenomenon in Philadelphia is driven

                To rigorously quantify the racial disparity, we applied Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition

            <h3>Shooting Density Gap</h3>
            <p>
                Predominantly Black tracts experience <strong>4.4x higher shooting density</strong> 
                (geometric mean ratio). The decomposition reveals:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>31.5% Explained:</strong> Attributable to differences in poverty rates and median income</li>

            </ul>

                The large unexplained portion suggests structural and historical factors beyond

            <h3>Transport Time Gap</h3>

                Black tracts are <strong>3.2 minutes closer</strong> to Level I trauma centers 
                on average. This finding confirms that the disparity in trauma burden is not 
                compounded by geographic access barriers.

            <h3>Stop the Bleed Training Prioritization</h3>
            <p>
                We identified 20 priority zones for community hemorrhage control training based 
                on a composite score of shooting density and transport time. The top 20 zones 
                contain 126,586 residents and experienced 2,607 shootings over the study period.
            </p>
            <p>
                Conservative estimates suggest community-based hemorrhage control training in 
                these zones could potentially save approximately 7 lives annually.
            </p>
            
            <h3>Scenario Modeling</h3>
            <p>
                Hypothetical placement of new trauma facilities was modeled at 8 candidate locations. 
                Key findings (using approximate distance-based travel time estimates):
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hunting Park:</strong> Highest overall impact score (would improve access for 198,932 residents)</li>
                <li><strong>Kingsessing/Cobbs Creek:</strong> Would help the most trauma desert tracts (8 of 18)</li>
                <li><strong>Frankford/Mayfair:</strong> Would reach the largest population (323,391)</li>
