## Executive Summary

This report presents findings from a comprehensive geospatial analysis of gun violence and trauma care access in Philadelphia. Using 11 years of shooting data (2015-2025) and drive-time modeling to Level I trauma centers, we identify neighborhoods facing compounded disadvantage and provide evidence-based recommendations for reducing preventable deaths.

### Key Findings at a Glance

| Finding | Implication |
|---------|-------------|
| **18 "trauma desert" neighborhoods** identified | 83,159 residents face both high violence AND delayed trauma access |
| **99.6% of shootings** occur within 20 min of Level I trauma | Geographic access is NOT the primary barrier |
| **Temple Hospital catchment** contains 54.9% of shootings | Two hospitals bear 82% of the city's trauma burden |
| **Fatality rate increases 50%** in distant areas | Each minute of transport time increases death odds by 1.5% |
| **68.5% of racial disparity** is unexplained by poverty | Structural factors beyond economics drive violence concentration |

### Top Recommendations

1. **Invest in violence prevention** in the 18 identified trauma desert neighborhoods
2. **Expand "Stop the Bleed" training** in high-burden communities
3. **Ensure adequate capacity** at Temple and Penn Presbyterian trauma centers
4. **Target intervention resources** using the priority zone rankings provided

## The Problem

### Gun Violence in Philadelphia

Philadelphia has experienced a gun violence crisis for decades, with over **17,000 shooting incidents** between 2015 and 2025. The human toll includes:

- **17,383 shooting victims** over 11 years
- **3,588 deaths** (20.6% fatality rate)
- **2,338 shootings in 2021 alone** (pandemic peak)

### What is a "Trauma Desert"?

A trauma desert is a neighborhood that faces **two compounding disadvantages**:

1. **High gun violence burden** (top third of shooting density)
2. **Poor access to trauma care** (top third of transport time)

Residents of trauma deserts face the worst of both worlds: high likelihood of being shot AND delayed access to life-saving surgical care.

## Key Findings

### Finding 1: We Identified 18 Trauma Desert Neighborhoods

Our analysis identified **18 census tracts** qualifying as trauma deserts, concentrated in:
- Far North Philadelphia
- Southwest Philadelphia  
- Parts of West Philadelphia

**Impact:**
- **83,159 residents** live in trauma deserts (5.2% of city)
- **1,659 shootings** occurred in these areas (9.5% of total)
- Disproportionately affects Black and low-income communities

### Finding 2: Geographic Access is Actually GOOD Citywide

Contrary to expectations, Philadelphia has **excellent geographic coverage** of Level I trauma care:

| Distance to Trauma | % of Shootings |
|-------------------|----------------|
| Within 10 minutes | 90.5% |
| Within 20 minutes | 99.6% |
| Beyond 20 minutes | 0.4% (62 shootings) |

**Implication:** Building new trauma centers or redistributing EMS resources would have **limited impact** because geographic access is already good for 99.6% of victims.

### Finding 3: Transport Time DOES Affect Survival

Our analysis of 17,380 shootings confirms that distance matters for survival:

| Transport Time | Fatality Rate |
|----------------|---------------|
| 0-5 minutes | 20.0% |
| 5-10 minutes | 20.8% |
| 10-15 minutes | 21.4% |
| 15-20 minutes | 26.5% |
| 20+ minutes | **30.6%** |

Each additional minute of transport time increases the odds of death by **1.5%** (statistically significant, p=0.005).

![Fatality by Transport Time](../figures/fatality_transport_analysis.png)
*Fatality rate increases with transport time*

### Finding 4: Two Hospitals Bear the Majority of Burden

Using modeled catchment areas based on nearest-center assignment:

| Hospital | % of City's Shootings |
|----------|----------------------|
| **Temple University Hospital** | **54.9%** |
| Penn Presbyterian Medical Center | 26.9% |
| Jefferson Einstein | 13.0% |
| Thomas Jefferson | 5.2% |

**Temple and Penn Presbyterian together serve catchment areas containing 82% of all shooting victims.**

These hospitals require adequate resources, staffing, and capacity to handle this burden.

### Finding 5: The Disparity is in Violence, Not Access

The most significant finding challenges conventional assumptions:

> **Black neighborhoods are actually CLOSER to trauma centers—but experience 4.4x higher shooting rates.**

| Metric | Black Tracts | Other Tracts |
|--------|--------------|--------------|
| Average transport time | 9.3 min | 12.4 min |
| Shooting density | **4.4x higher** | baseline |

Only 31.5% of this disparity is explained by differences in poverty and income. **68.5% reflects structural and historical factors** not captured by current socioeconomic indicators.

**The problem is violence concentration, not distance to care.**

## Priority Neighborhoods for Intervention

Based on our analysis, we have identified **20 priority zones** for targeted intervention:

### Top 5 Priority Census Tracts

| Rank | Tract | Shootings | Transport Time | Priority Score |
|------|-------|-----------|----------------|----------------|
| 1 | 300 (North Philly) | 253 | 15 min | Highest |
| 2 | 330 (Far North) | 66 | 20 min | Very High |
| 3 | 298 (North Philly) | 84 | 15 min | Very High |
| 4 | 178 (North Philly) | 371 | 10 min | High |
| 5 | 63 (West Philly) | 89 | 15 min | High |

The **top 20 priority zones** contain:
- 126,586 residents
- 2,607 historical shootings
- Average transport time of 12.9 minutes

## Recommendations

### Recommendation 1: Violence Prevention Investment

**Target:** City Council, Mayor's Office, Philadelphia Department of Public Health

The 18 identified trauma desert tracts should receive **priority funding** for:

- **Community violence intervention programs** (hospital-based and community-based)
- **Youth employment and opportunity programs**
- **Conflict mediation and de-escalation services**
- **Mental health and trauma-informed care services**

**Rationale:** Since geographic access is already good, the most effective intervention is reducing violence in the first place.

### Recommendation 2: Expand Community Hemorrhage Control

**Target:** Philadelphia Fire Department, Department of Public Health, Community Organizations

Deploy "**Stop the Bleed**" hemorrhage control training in priority neighborhoods:

**Priority training sites:**
1. Public schools (teachers, staff, older students)
2. SEPTA transit stations
3. Recreation centers
4. Churches and community centers
5. Corner stores and businesses

**Potential impact:** Conservative estimates suggest training in the top 20 zones could save **approximately 7 lives annually** by enabling bystanders to control bleeding before EMS arrival.

### Recommendation 3: Hospital Capacity Assurance

**Target:** Temple University Hospital, Penn Presbyterian, Health System Leadership

Ensure the hospitals bearing the greatest trauma burden have:

- **Adequate trauma bay capacity**
- **Sufficient surgical and nursing staff**
- **Resources for surge capacity** during violence spikes
- **Support for staff wellness** (secondary trauma is significant)

Temple University Hospital alone handles over half of the city's shooting victims. Its capacity must be protected and enhanced.

### Recommendation 4: Data-Driven Resource Allocation

**Target:** Philadelphia Police Department, Fire Department, Managing Director's Office

Use the geographic analysis provided to:

- **Position EMS units** near high-burden areas
- **Pre-stage resources** during high-risk time periods (summer evenings, weekends)
- **Route trauma patients** directly to Level I centers when possible
- **Monitor trends** to detect emerging hotspots

### Recommendation 5: Address Root Causes

**Target:** City Council, State Legislature, Federal Partners

The finding that 68.5% of the violence disparity is "unexplained" by current socioeconomics points to **structural and historical factors**:

- Generational disinvestment in affected neighborhoods
- Historical residential segregation patterns
- Differential access to economic opportunity
- Accumulated trauma and concentrated disadvantage

Long-term solutions require addressing these root causes through:
- Equitable economic development
- Housing stability programs
- Educational opportunity investment
- Reparative justice initiatives

## Scenario Modeling: Where Would New Resources Help Most?

If resources were available for a **new trauma capability or mobile unit**, our analysis ranked potential locations:

| Location | Population Reached | Shootings in Area | Trauma Deserts Helped |
|----------|-------------------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Hunting Park** | 198,932 | 4,998 | 0 |
| **Kingsessing/Cobbs Creek** | 166,003 | 2,974 | 8 |
| Tioga/Nicetown | 174,801 | 3,477 | 2 |
| Frankford/Mayfair | 323,391 | 2,106 | 5 |

- **Hunting Park** = highest shooting coverage
- **Kingsessing/Cobbs Creek** = most trauma deserts improved

## Temporal Context: COVID and Beyond

Gun violence in Philadelphia spiked dramatically during the COVID-19 pandemic:

| Period | Annual Average | Change |
|--------|----------------|--------|
| 2015-2019 | 1,361 | baseline |
| 2020-2021 | 2,297 | **+69%** |
| 2022-2025 | 1,495 | +10% |

Violence has declined from the 2021 peak but remains **elevated above pre-pandemic levels**. Continued investment in prevention and response is essential.

## Conclusion

Philadelphia's "trauma desert" challenge is primarily a **violence concentration problem**, not a geographic access problem. While transport time significantly affects survival, 99.6% of shooting victims are already within 20 minutes of Level I trauma care.

The path forward requires:

1. **Preventing violence** in affected neighborhoods
2. **Equipping communities** with hemorrhage control skills
3. **Supporting the hospitals** that bear the burden
4. **Addressing root causes** of concentrated disadvantage

The data and analysis in this report provide an evidence base for targeted, effective intervention. We stand ready to support city agencies and community organizations in using these findings to save lives.
