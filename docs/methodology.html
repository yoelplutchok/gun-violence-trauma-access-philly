            <h2>Research Purpose</h2>
            <p>
                This study addresses a fundamental public health question: <strong>Is there a spatial 
                mismatch between gun violence burden and timely access to Level I trauma care in 
                Philadelphia?</strong> The "golden hour" principle in trauma care establishes that 
                survival rates decline significantly when definitive surgical care is delayed beyond 
                60 minutes post-injury. For penetrating trauma such as gunshot wounds, the first 
                10-20 minutes are particularly critical for hemorrhage control.
            </p>
            <p>
                We operationalize "trauma desert" status through bivariate classification, identifying 
                census tracts that simultaneously experience high violence burden and extended transport 
                times to Level I trauma centers. This approach moves beyond simple proximity analysis 
                to capture the compounding disadvantage of both exposure and access barriers.

            <h2>Data Sources</h2>
            
            <h3>Shooting Incident Data</h3>
            <p>
                Shooting victim data was obtained from OpenDataPhilly, the City of Philadelphia's 
                open data portal. The dataset includes all reported shooting incidents from January 2015 
                through December 2025, with geocoded coordinates, victim demographics, and outcome 
                information. After removing records with invalid coordinates, the analysis includes 
                17,383 shooting incidents.
            </p>

            <h3>Trauma Center Locations</h3>
            <p>
                Level I and Level II trauma centers were identified from the Pennsylvania Trauma 
                Systems Foundation (PTSF) accreditation registry and verified against the American 
                College of Surgeons trauma center verification database. Philadelphia contains four 
                Level I Adult trauma centers (Temple University Hospital, Penn Presbyterian Medical 
                Center, Thomas Jefferson University Hospital, and Jefferson Einstein Philadelphia Hospital), 
                two Level I Pediatric centers, and one Level II Adult center.
            </p>

            <h3>Drive-Time Isochrones</h3>
            <p>
                Travel time polygons were generated using the OpenRouteService API with driving-car 
                profile. For each Level I Adult trauma center, isochrones were computed at 5, 10, 15, 
                20, and 30 minute intervals. These represent the geographic area reachable within each 
                time threshold under typical traffic conditions.
            </p>

            <h3>Census Geography and Demographics</h3>
            <p>
                Census tract boundaries were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau TIGER/Line files. 
                Demographic data including population, racial composition, and poverty rates were 
                obtained from the American Community Survey 5-year estimates. Philadelphia County 
                contains 408 census tracts.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Analytical Methods</h2>

            <h3>Spatial Assignment</h3>
            <p>
                Each shooting incident was assigned to a census tract using point-in-polygon spatial 
                join. Of 17,383 cleaned records, 17,380 were successfully assigned to tracts; 3 records 
                with coordinates outside Philadelphia tract boundaries were excluded from tract-based 
                analyses. Tract centroids were computed and used to determine transport time categories 
                based on isochrone containment. Transport time to the nearest Level I Adult trauma 
                center was categorized into discrete intervals (0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-30, 30+ minutes).
            </p>

            <h3>Shooting Density Calculation</h3>
            <p>
                For each tract, shooting density was calculated as the total number of shootings 
                divided by tract area (in square miles) divided by the number of years in the study 
                period (11 years). This produces a standardized rate of shootings per square mile 
                per year, enabling comparison across tracts of varying size.
            </p>

            <h3>Bivariate Classification</h3>
            <p>
                Tracts were classified using a 3x3 bivariate matrix combining shooting density terciles 
                and transport time terciles. Tercile thresholds were computed using all 408 tracts:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Shooting Density:</strong> Low (bottom third), Medium (middle third), High (top third)</li>
                <li><strong>Transport Time:</strong> Low/Good (bottom third), Medium (middle third), High/Poor (top third)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The resulting 9-class system identifies "trauma deserts" as Class 9 tracts with both 
                high shooting density AND high transport time.
            </p>

            <h3>Statistical Testing</h3>
            <p>
                Demographic comparisons between trauma desert and non-trauma desert tracts were 
                conducted using Welch's t-test (unequal variance). Correlations between variables 
                were assessed using Pearson's r. All tests used alpha = 0.05 for significance.
            </p>

            <h3>Oaxaca-Blinder Decomposition</h3>
            <p>
                To quantify the racial disparity in violence burden, we applied Oaxaca-Blinder 
                decomposition separating tracts into predominantly Black (50%+ Black population, n=143) 
                and other tracts (n=246). The decomposition separates the gap into:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Explained portion:</strong> Attributable to differences in observed characteristics (poverty rate, median income)</li>
                <li><strong>Unexplained portion:</strong> Residual gap not explained by observable factors</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Shooting density was log-transformed (log1p) for the decomposition to address 
                skewness. The reported ratio (4.4x) represents the geometric mean ratio 
                exp(mean log density difference).
            </p>
            
            <h3>Fatality-Transport Analysis</h3>
            <p>
                To validate the theoretical basis for the trauma desert framework, we tested whether 
                transport time is associated with fatality outcomes in this dataset. Using the binary 
                fatality indicator in the shooting data:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Chi-square test:</strong> Association between transport time category and fatality (5 categories)</li>
                <li><strong>Logistic regression:</strong> Fatality ~ Transport Time (minutes), with odds ratio per minute</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This analysis provides within-dataset evidence supporting the clinical relevance of 
                transport time, complementing the extensive published literature on trauma transport 
                and mortality.
            </p>
